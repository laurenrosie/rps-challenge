As a marketeer
So that I can see my name in lights
I would like to register my name before playing an online game

As a marketeer
So that I can enjoy myself away from the daily grind
I would like to be able to play rock/paper/scissors

As a Big Bang Fan-person
So that I can enjoy myself away from the daily grind
I would like to be able to play rock/paper/scissors/lizard/spock
